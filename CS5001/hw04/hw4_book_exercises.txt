1.The results remain the same. When user entered "0", the code inside
the if statement will not be executed, but any number plus 0 is the number 
itself. Therefore the results remain the same.

2.The results remain the same, but the condition for exiting the loop changed.
When a user entered "0", it will exit the loop.

3.It will go into an infinite loop if we enter a nonnegative number first, 
print out sum=0 if we enter a negative number first. It's a bad thing to move the 
assignment out of the loop since the condition for exiting the loop does not 
update inside the loop.

4.The code fragment will print 100 asterisks 

5.The code fragment will print infinite asterisks since it's an infinite loop.
