• The AI does not choose a random legal move, instead, it will scan through
all legal moves and choose one that filps the most black tiles.

• Here is my implementation: "Pick next move" Algorithm
Create an empty list, for every grid in the board, call the check_legal_move()
method in Tile class to see if the current grid is a legal move for AI. If so,
add the move to the list. At the same time, check the number of black tiles
that will be flipped if make the move, compare with the previous moves and
store the one that will flipped the most black tiles as best move.

• I played with computer for 5 times and did my best to beat the computer. I
won 3 out of 5 times.

• Possible improvement for AI
After checking the possible legal moves for itself in the current round, AI will
check and record all possible human's legal move. For each possible human's move,
AI will continuously check the legal moves for itself(so on and so forth), and choose
the move that filps the most black tiles.
