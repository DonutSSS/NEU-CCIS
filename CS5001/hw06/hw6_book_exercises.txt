1. No, the function proc() has already been defined. 

2. Yes, but the program won't print anything.

3. No, function proc() does not have a return value, therefore proc(5) is not determined.

4. Yes, the program will print 26 as result.

5. No, the function proc() needs two arguments, while there is only on argument when calling proc().

6. No, the function proc() needs only one argument, while it passed two arguments when calling proc().

7. Yes, the program will print 50 as result.

8. It will print 10 instead. After passing the argument 10 to the function proc(), the return value 200 has
    not been assigned to any variable. 'num' is still equal to 10, so it will print 10 instead.

9. Yes, the program is legal. The actual parameter and formal can have the same name.

10. Yes, the program is legal. When calling the function proc(), the actual parameter's value y = 10 is assigned to 
    formal parameter x automatically. x and y are just symbols.
