Grid class:
Grid class initialize the checkerboard with a background color and several lines,
so it doesn't need test.

Tile class:
test_constructor():
We'll test the constructor to see if it generated a nested list, with following
value: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 1, 0], [0, 1, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]], where 1 stands
for black tile, 2 stands for white tile. The initialization is defined using a
formula like: self.tile[self.row // 2 - 1][self.col // 2 - 1] = 2 such that we 
still get four middle points right when the board changes. 


The display and update method in tile class just implement some graphical functionalities,
so they do not need testing.
