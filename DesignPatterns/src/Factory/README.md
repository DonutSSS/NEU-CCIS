###Factory Method Pattern 
Factory handles the details of object creation. A factory method handles object creation and encapsulates it in a subclass. This decouples the client code in the superclass from the object creation code in the subclass.
A factory can be external or reside inside the object as an inner class(access the private constructor).  
  
Use the Factory Method when you donâ€™t know beforehand the exact types and dependencies of the objects your code should work with.
