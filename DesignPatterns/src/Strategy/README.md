###Strategy Pattern   
The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy 
lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it. It enables the exact behavior of a system to be selected 
either at run-time(dynamic) or compile-time(static).
