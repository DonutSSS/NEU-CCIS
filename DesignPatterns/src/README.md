###Design Patterns   
**Design patterns** are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.   

#### Categories    
**Creational Patterns** involve object instantiation and all provide a way to decouple a client from the objects it needs to instantiate.  
* Singleton, Abstract Factory, Factory Method, Builder, Prototype  

**Behavioral Pattern** is concerned with how classes and objects interact and distribute responsibility.   
* Template Method, Iterator, Command, Observer, State, Strategy, Mediator, Visitor, Interpreter, Chain of Responsibility    

**Structural Patterns** let you compose classes or objects into larger structures.  
* Decorator, Proxy, Composite, Facade, Adapter, Bridge, Flyweight   


#### Description   
* **Decorator** wraps an object to provide new behavior.  
* **State** encapsulates state-based behaviors and uses delegation to switch between behaviors.   
* **Iterator** provides a way to traverse a collection of objects without exposing its implementation.   
* **Facade** simplifies the interface of a set of classes.   
* **Strategy** encapsulates interchangeable behaviors and uses delegation to decide which one to use.   
* **Proxy** simplifies the interface of a set of classes.   
* **Factory Method** subclasses decide which concrete classes to create.   
* **Adapter** wraps an object and provides a different interface to it.   
* **Observer**  allows objects to be notified when state changes.   
* **Template Method** subclasses decide how to implement steps in an algorithm.   
* **Composite** clients treat collections of objects and individual objects uniformly.   
* **Singleton** ensures one and only object is created.   
* **Abstract Factory** allows a client to create families of objects without specifying their concrete classes.   
* **Command** encapsulates a request as an objects.
